Lecture slides for the International Trade course that I co-taught (with Scott Orr) in the summer of 2016. The slides are updated versions of the slides of previous instructors of the course (Mengxiao Liu and Christian Dippel).

I used the Beamer class on Lyx to create the slides and OmniGraffle Pro to create the figures.
